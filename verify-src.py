"""Pre-build source checks for FOXAssetBrowser.

Catches the classes of mistake that have actually broken this build, cheaply, before a
multi-minute MSVC cycle:

  0. Empty / truncated file         — a botched write that left 0 bytes. Checked FIRST and
                                      alone, because an empty file passes every other check
                                      here: it has balanced delimiters, no bad format strings
                                      and no duplicate lambdas. Two files were blanked and this
                                      script reported "131 file(s) clean".
  1. Unbalanced {} () []            — truncated or mis-spliced edits.
  2. Missing #include for a         — a header-only helper used as `Ns::Thing` with no
     header-only helper               matching include directive. THIS is the one that broke
                                      three translation units: a *comment* mentioning the path
                                      satisfied a naive substring check, so the include was
                                      never added. Only a real directive counts here.
  3. printf-style arg mismatch      — qInfo/qWarning/qDebug/printf format specifiers vs args.
  4. Qt macro collisions            — a local named `emit`/`signals`/`slots` silently vanishes.

Exit code 0 = clean, 1 = problems found. Run from anywhere:

    python verify-src.py                 # check src/
    python verify-src.py --quiet         # only print problems
    python verify-src.py path/to/file    # check specific files
